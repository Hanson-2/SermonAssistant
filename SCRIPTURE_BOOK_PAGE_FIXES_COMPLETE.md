# Scripture Book Page Fixes - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully resolved all identified issues in the Scripture Book Page related to styling, translation display, and navigation functionality.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Back Button Theme Color Integration
**Problem**: Back button had hardcoded blue border instead of matching user's theme color
**Solution**: 
- Updated CSS to use CSS custom properties: `var(--primary-color, #e0c97f)`
- Added engraved effect with multiple box-shadow layers
- Enhanced hover and active states with theme color integration

**Changes Made**:
```css
border: 2px solid var(--primary-color, #e0c97f);
box-shadow: 
  0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3),
  inset 0 1px 1px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1),
  inset 0 -1px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
```

### 2. ✅ Translation Duplicate Handling
**Problem**: Translation buttons showed duplicates like "EXB" and "exb"
**Solution**: 
- Implemented translation normalization to uppercase during verse processing
- Added deduplication logic in the translation grouping process

**Changes Made**:
```typescript
// Normalize translation to uppercase for consistent display
const normalizedTranslation = v.translation.toUpperCase();
```

### 3. ✅ Translation Case Consistency 
**Problem**: Some translations displayed in lowercase instead of uppercase
**Solution**: 
- Force uppercase display in translation buttons: `{tr.toUpperCase()}`
- Normalize translations during data processing to prevent mixed case storage

### 4. ✅ Translation Prioritization
**Problem**: User's preferred translation (EXB) wasn't prioritized/shown first
**Solution**: 
- Implemented sorting logic to move EXB to the front for authorized users
- Enhanced translation selection to automatically prefer EXB when available

**Changes Made**:
```typescript
// Sort translations to prioritize user's preferred translation (EXB) first if available
const sortedTranslations = [...filteredTranslations].sort((a, b) => {
  if (userId === "89UdurybrVSwbPmp4boEMeYdVzk1") {
    if (a === "EXB" && b !== "EXB") return -1;
    if (b === "EXB" && a !== "EXB") return 1;
  }
  return a.localeCompare(b);
});
```
