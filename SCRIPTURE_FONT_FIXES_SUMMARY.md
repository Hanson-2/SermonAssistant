# Scripture Reference and Font Functionality Fixes

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ **Fixed Cursor Jumping to Front of Reference**
- **Problem**: When typing scripture references inline, the cursor would automatically move to the front of the reference during wrapping
- **Solution**: 
  - Added cursor position preservation before DOM manipulation
  - Implemented `restoreCursorPosition()` function to intelligently restore cursor position
  - Ensured cursor moves outside scripture spans to prevent interference with typing

### 2. ✅ **Fixed Style Bleeding to New Text**
- **Problem**: Scripture reference styling was being applied to subsequent text typed after references
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced cursor positioning logic to move cursor outside styled spans
  - Added CSS rules to prevent style inheritance
  - Improved DOM manipulation to ensure proper text node separation

### 3. ✅ **Added Chapter-Only Reference Support**
- **Problem**: Scripture references like "Gen 1" or "Genesis 1" weren't being recognized
- **Solution**:
  - Updated `smartParseScriptureInput.ts` to support chapter-only references
  - Added separate regex pattern for chapter-only matching
  - Made `verse` property optional in `ScriptureReference` type
  - Enhanced reference parsing to handle both chapter:verse and chapter-only formats

### 4. ✅ **Improved Font Functionality**
- **Problem**: Font changes weren't working properly due to missing event handlers
- **Solution**:
  - Added missing `handleInput`, `handleCompositionStart`, and `handleCompositionEnd` functions
  - Maintained existing robust font application logic
  - Enhanced font preview in dropdown with inline styles for each option

### 5. ✅ **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Problem**: Scripture wrapping was too aggressive and interfered with typing
- **Solution**:
  - Increased debounce delay from 800ms to 1500ms
  - Improved timing to reduce interruption while typing
  - Added better conflict resolution between font styling and scripture wrapping

## Files Modified

### `src/utils/smartParseScriptureInput.ts`
- Updated `ScriptureReference` type to make `verse` optional
- Added `chapterOnlyRegex` for chapter-only reference detection
- Enhanced `extractScriptureReferences()` to handle both verse-specific and chapter-only references
- Added intelligent duplicate detection to prevent overlapping matches

### `src/utils/wrapScriptureRefsInEditor.ts`
- Added cursor position preservation with `cursorInfo` storage
- Implemented `restoreCursorPosition()` function for intelligent cursor restoration
- Enhanced `findAndWrapText()` to prevent style bleeding
- Updated `parseReference()` to handle chapter-only references
- Improved DOM manipulation for better text node handling

### `src/components/BasicRichTextEditor.tsx`
- Added missing event handlers: `handleInput`, `handleCompositionStart`, `handleCompositionEnd`
- Implemented font preview styling in dropdown options
- Increased debounce delay to 1500ms for better user experience
- Enhanced font family dropdown with inline styles

### `src/components/CustomRichTextEditor.css`
- Added Google Fonts import for proper font previews
- Enhanced font dropdown styling for better appearance
- Added CSS rules to prevent scripture reference style bleeding
- Improved cursor positioning rules

## Testing Instructions

### Font Functionality Testing
1. **Font Changes**: Select text and change font family - verify changes apply properly
2. **Font Preview**: Open font dropdown - verify each option displays in its actual font
3. **Font Persistence**: Ensure font changes persist and don't reset unexpectedly

### Scripture Reference Testing
1. **Verse References**: Type "John 3:16", "Romans 8:28" - verify golden highlighting after 1.5s
2. **Chapter References**: Type "Gen 1", "Genesis 1", "Matthew 5" - verify chapter-only references highlight
3. **Range References**: Type "Matthew 5:3-12" - verify verse ranges work properly

### Integration Testing
1. **No Cursor Jumping**: Type scripture references - cursor should stay at end, not jump to front
2. **No Style Bleeding**: Type text after highlighted references - new text should have normal styling
3. **Font + Scripture**: Apply fonts to text with scripture references - both should work together
4. **Typing Flow**: Continuous typing should not be interrupted by scripture wrapping

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ **Proper Cursor Behavior**
- Cursor stays at typing position during reference detection
- No jumping to front of references
- Smooth typing experience without interruption

### ✅ **Style Isolation**
- Scripture references have golden highlighting
- New text after references has normal styling
- Font changes apply independently of scripture styling

### ✅ **Enhanced Reference Detection**
- Supports both "John 3:16" (verse) and "John 3" (chapter) formats
- Recognizes common abbreviations (Gen, Matt, Rom, etc.)
- Works with full book names (Genesis, Matthew, Romans, etc.)

### ✅ **Improved Font Experience**
- Font dropdown shows preview of each font
- Font changes apply reliably
- Works seamlessly with scripture reference functionality

## Technical Improvements

- **Debounced Processing**: 1.5s delay reduces typing interruption
- **Smart Cursor Management**: Preserves user intent during DOM manipulation
- **Conflict Resolution**: Font and scripture features work together harmoniously
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient regex patterns and DOM operations
- **User Experience**: Minimal disruption to natural typing flow

All changes maintain backward compatibility and enhance the existing functionality without breaking current features.
